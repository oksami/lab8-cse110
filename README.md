1. (1) Automated tests would go within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed, so that the tests can automatically run every time the code is changed and committed.
2. No
3. Would not use a unit test to test the message feature of a messaging application because a messaging feature has several functions to test which cannot be done with a unit test.
4. Would use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application because it is a single functionality of the feature with just the length to check, which can be done with a unit test.
